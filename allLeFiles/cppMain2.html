            <p>
                Hey pal it's good to see you again, looks like you finished the first part of the show and
                now you're ready for the second part. Truly a good experience isn't it? Let's get the show
                started...

                    <h2>Classes basics and programming paradigms</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now we're getting in the real deal, the real meat of c++ and programming, the classes
                        and programming paradigms. So what is a class? Now i have mentioned classes before
                        in the string section of the previous page, but i didn't really explain it so now
                        let's get into it. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, which you know that
                        string is also a class in c++, so a class is just a way to define a type of data
                        in this case, you can define your own type of data, like a car, a person, or anything
                        you can imagine really... Let's get into some examples of classes, so here is a simple
                        class that defines a gun: <br /> <pre><code>
                            class Gun {<br />
                            public:<br />
                                int ammo;<br />
                            void shoot() {<br />
                                ammo--;<br />
                                std::cout << "Bang!" << std::endl;<br />
                            }<br />
                            };
                        </code></pre>
                        <br /> Now what do we have here? Well we have a class named <code>Gun</code> that has
                        a keyword called "public" which is something called an access specifier, that allows
                        us to access the members of the class from outside the class, and we have a member
                        variable called <code>ammo</code> which is an integer that stores the amount of ammo
                        the gun has, and we have a member function called <code>shoot</code> that decreases
                        the ammo by 1 and prints out "Bang!", and now you might be wondering what is access
                        specifier and member in the context of a class...
