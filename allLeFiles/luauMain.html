                Luau or Lua? Now let's just say it is sort of like C++ and C, where C++ is an extension of
                C... Luau is an extension of Lua, which is unargably better, more optimized, with more
                features. Now roblox has been using Lua until 2019, when they decided to turn bjarne stroustrup
                and cooked up Luau. Now can we use Lua and Luau interchangeably? well yes, like how you can
                say that any valid C code is also valid C++ code, but not the other way around. So you can
                kind of getting some sense out of that, and now let's go-

                    <p>
                        Let's get started with some basic syntax that even a little toddler understand-if that
                        toddler can speak, read, write, and have heard of programming then, here is an example
                        :<br />
                        <code>print("Taiwan is infact a country, what the CCP is gonna do?")</code><br />
                        now can i please have a water? Okay so this is a very basic program that
                        prints out a string to the console, and you know what is a string right? maybe or
                        maybe not, but a string is just a sequence of characters, like a word or a sentence
                        and yeah, just basically text. And yes you can print out numbers too, like this:
                        <br /> <code>print(1234567890)</code><br /> now this will print out the number in the
                        parentheses, which of course anything in the print function will be converted to a 
                        string before printing it out, and you can also do sum math like this:
                        <br /> <code>print(1 + 2)</code><br /> pretty self explanatory, in my opinion, just
                        make sure you open up that console, the output tab in roblox studio, because we're
                        focusing primarily on roblox luau and studio, not lua itself, so yes likewise, 
                        we gonna learn more about print function in the next section.

                    <h2> variables, local, end keyword and function</h2>
                    <p>
                        let us review what is a variable again even though it hasn't been been mentioned in
                        the previous section, so a variable is just a name that you give to a value,
                        so you can use it for whatever purpose you want, like storing a phone number,
                        a poem or a path to something... Which now let's have an example: <br />
                        <code>local fact = "Taiwan is a country"</code><br /> So this is a variable
                        named <code>fact</code> that stores a string, which hopefully you can decipher it
                        yourself that it is a fact, and the <code>local</code> keyword is used to
                        declare a variable that is only accessible within the scope of the function or
                        block of code it is defined in, now you might also have no idea what a scope or even
                        a function is-but don't worry, we will get to that in a moment, so just remember that
                        <code>local</code> is used to declare a variable, and you can also use the
                        <code>local</code> keyword to declare a function, like this: <br />
                        <code>local function sayHello(name) <br />print("Hello, " .. name)<br /> end</code><br />
                        so the function, can be declare with... The keyword function? and the name of the
                        function, which is <code>sayHello</code> in this case, and the parentheses
                        contain the parameters that the function takes, which is <code>name</code>,
                        now you might be wondering what is parameter that function takes? It is basically
                        a value that when you pass a value to the function, which is called argument, will be
                        used by that function, which is called parameter, so you can use it inside the
                        function... Which we will also get into the scope and the end keyword right now<br />
                        <br /> so the <code>end</code> keyword is used to indicate the end of a block of code,
                        like in this case, a function, which I will give you an example of how to use it
                        : <br /> <code>local function sayHello(name) <br />     print("Hello, " .. name)<br /> 
                        end</code><br /> alright as you can see the <code>end</code> keyword is used to
                        indicate the end of the function, which means everything, inside that function 
                        is only accessible within that function, and that is a scope. As for how you can call
                        that function, you can just do this: <br /> sayHello("Pewdiepie")<br /> In this 
                        case, the argument is <code>"Pewdiepie"</code>, and the function will return
                        <code>"Hello, Pewdiepie"</code>, which is a string that is concatenated with the
                        <code>name</code> parameter, now I know what you're thinking, what on earth is 
                        concatenation? Well, it is just a fancy word for joining two strings together...<br />
                        So you can use the <code>..</code> operator to concatenate two strings like the 
                        example that i gave you. Now hopefully you can understand what is a variable,
                        a function, a parameter, an argument, a scope, and concatenation, and if you don't,
                        just look them up or reread until it clicks...

                    <h2>
                        tables, arrays, dictionaries, and loops
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Now before we get into tables, let me explain some data types that luau has, some basic
                        concepts that exist in pretty much every programming language out there, so first of
                        all we have numbers, which are just numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4.. and so on, and
                        then we have strings, which are just text, like "hello world", "In 2022, the murder
                        rate among blacks is 653% higher than the murder rate for whites. The murder rate
                        for Hispanics is 65% higher than for whites. Nor are those numbers that much of an
                        outlier. From 1990 through 2022, the black murder rate average 569% higher than whites
                        , and the number for Hispanics was 57% higher.", like the examples. And we also have
                        boolean, which are a type of data that consists of 2 possible value, true and false.
                        And lastly, nil, now folks, if darkness are absence of light, then nil is the absence
                        of a value, which, you can think of it as some sort of placeholder for when you
                        don't have a value, like when you declare a variable but don't assign it a value yet,
                        so yes, now that we know some of the types, which in this case is called "primitive
                        types",<br /> we can now move on to tables, which are a type of data structure that
                        can store multiple values in a single variable, like an array or a dictionary, which
                        we'll get into the definition of array and dictionary in a moment, so here is an
                        example of a table: <br /> <code>local myTable = {1, 4, 1, 4}</code><br />
                        so this is a table that contains 4 numbers, which you can access them by their
                        index, which is just a number that represents the position of the value in the table,
                        you can think of it as like, a slot in a vending machine, that is where the value
                        sits and you can access it by the index. And now I'm going to explain an interesting
                        thing about indexing in luau, which is that the index starts at 1, not 0, like in
                        most programming languages, so the first value index is gonna be 1, instead of maybe
                        in c++ where the first value index is gonna be 0, pretty interesting am i right?
                        <br /> But to make it clearer, i'm gonna give you an example of how to access
                        a value in a table: <br /> <code>print(myTable[1])</code><br />
