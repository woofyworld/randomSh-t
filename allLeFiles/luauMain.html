                Luau or Lua? Now let's just say it is sort of like C++ and C, where C++ is an extension of
                C... Luau is an extension of Lua, which is unargably better, more optimized, with more
                features. Now roblox has been using Lua until 2019, when they decided turn bjarne stroustrup
                and cooked up Luau. Now can we use Lua and Luau interchangeably? well yes, like how you can
                say that any valid C code is also valid C++ code, but not the other way around. So you can
                kind of getting some sense out of that, and now let's go-

                <!--<h3><a href=".html">go to page 2</a></h3>-->
            </div>

                    <p>
                        Let's get started with some basic syntax that even a little toddler understand-if that
                        toddler can speak, read, write, and have heard of programming then, here is an example
                        :<br />
                        <code>print("Taiwan is infact a country, what the CCP is gonna do?")</code><br />
                        now excuse me can i get a water please? Okay so this is a very basic program that
                        prints out a string to the console, and you know what is a string right? maybe or
                        maybe not, but a string is just a sequence of characters, like a word or a sentence
                        and yeah, just basically text. And yes you can print out numbers too, like this:
                        <br /> <code>print(1234567890)</code><br /> now this will print out the number in the
                        parentheses, which of course anything in the print will be converted to a string
                        before printing it out, and you can also do sum math like this:
                        <br /> <code>print(1 + 2)</code><br /> pretty self explanatory, in my opinion, just
                        make sure you open up that console, the output tab in roblox studio, because we're
                        focusing primarily on roblox luau and studio, not lua itself, so yes likewise, 
                        we gonna learn more about print function in the next section.
