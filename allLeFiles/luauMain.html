            <h3>Right off the bat</h3>
            <p>
                Let's talk about the elephant in the room. Some people, including me, has probably... Uses
                Lua and Luau interchangeably. Which is not actually correct because Luau is like C++ to C,
                a modified, unarguedly better, with more features and not kidding, more popular. Now let me
                tell you about Lua history first, it was created in 1993 by a group of Brazilian computer
                scientists. It is fast, lightweight, easy, and flexible. And then come Luau, which was
                when David baszucki decided to go "hey why don't we follow stroustrup and make a better
                version of the language we're using for our game engine"(not literal). So yes roblox was
                using the actual Lua for a long time, and then they decided to upgrade it in 2019. Okay now
                enough history, let's get to the fun part
