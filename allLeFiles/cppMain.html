            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                C++ is a really good language, there is C++ everywhere!
                Made by the ultimate giga chad Bjarne Stroustrup at bell labs. So likewise, you wanna get
                into C++? I'm 'bout to tell you, it <b>ain't easy</b>. But It ain't impossible either
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><h2>I AM THE GOD OF HELLFILE, AND I BRING YOU.. FILE </h2></li>
                <li><p>So what on earth is this? hello world is generic.. SO let's print something 
                    else, here is a boiler plate for a c++ file</p></li>
                <li><pre><code>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    int main() {
        std::cout << "I AM THE GOD OF HELLFILE";
    }
</code></pre></li>
                <li><p>
                    What on earth is goin' on? Now it's time for inline comment to shine <br />
                    //this is a comment, double slash as in double tap<br /> //what is include?
                    a hash tag and the <b>include</b> keyword. Now "include", it is used to, well,
                    includes this type of file called "header", similar to a library, it will let you to
                    utilize the codes in the included header, like functions, classes.. <br /><br />
                    /*the header is "iostream", which we need to get our printing magic working. The main function,
                    serves as the, well, you name it, the main function of the program. This is where
                    your code will first be executed when you run the program.. As this function will be called
                    automatically, just make sure it is called <b>main</b>. <br /> as for the "std::cout" line
                    let me explain, std is the abbreviation for standard, which is the standard library that
                    C++ uses, it is a, really tremendous library, it have everything that C++ needs to
                    operates.. and iostream is a part of it, so when we use <b>std</b>, we specify that we're
                    using the std "namespace" <br /> Oh boy, now what is namespace? A namespace is like a
                    folder or a last name for your code
                    It helps you organize your functions, classes, and variables without name collisions,
                    Think of it this way:<br />
                    You're at a party and there are three people named <code>cout</code>. You shout "Hey cout!"<br />
                    Suddenly, chaos. Three confused programmers turn around<br /> as for the "::", this is
                    called scope resolution, we're going to see a lot more examples, but for now, it basically
                    let you select a specific function or variable from a specific class or namespace, like i
                    want to access a cake in bakeryOne, so i say <code>bakeryOne::chocolateCake</code><br />
                    in this case cout is part of std, So <code>std::cout</code> is our gateway to
                    print text. And guess what?<br />
                    <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the "insertion operator".
                    You're not just sending text. You're jamming it into the stream like stuffing glitter into
                    an envelope*/<br /><br /></p>

                    >Still gotta do it i guess<br />
</h5> in C++, declaring a varible is quite simple.. We have several built in types, such as int, char, bool.. 
                    for an example, let's declare an interger variable: <br /><code>int i = 88;</code><br />
                    as you can see, we first need to declare a type for the variable, then the name, 
                    the variable's value are optional, meaning you can leave it without initialize any value
                    to the variable, just don't forget the semicolon ";", they pretty much just represent
                    the end of a statement, so always put them at the end. You can also initialize 
                    variable in a couple of ways, using =, using (), using {} -> <br /> int i = 1;
                    int i(1); int i{1};<br /></p>
                <li><p>C++ uses something called "static type checking", meaning you have to manually
                    declare the type for variables, instead of for example, JavaScript, where type are
                    dynamically check based on its value.. As for me I prefer static type, as it will
                    gives you more clarity on the intended type of the variable, including functions, 
                    and it is also faster</p></li>
                <li><p>Let's also talk about function, here is how to declare a function:<br />
                    <code>int squaredNumber(int x) { return x*x; }</code><br /> so the anatomy of a valid
                    function, you'll need, the type, the name, "()" also called function call operator, 
                    and lastly, {} two curly braces. You can also take something called parameter, in 
                    the parenthesis, like you've seen, (int x), this will specify the type when the value
                    is passed to the parameter, when we pass a value to a function, it is called "argument"
                    <br /> for example i can do something like this: <code>int squared = 
                    squaredNumber(2);</code> <br /> and then I'll print it: <code>std::cout << squared 
                    << std::endl;</code> <br /> as we can see, we assigned the result of squaredNumber to
                    the variable squared, which it should be 4 because we pass 2 as the argument. and then
                    print the variable which will give us 4 as the output, we also have some new keywords,
                    in which I'll also give you the definition of each.. <br /><br /> <code>return</code>: 
                    end the function execution and, like the name, it return a value to where it was 
                    requested, and in this case, it is our variable.<br /> <code>endl</code>: it adds a new 
                    line(I know you've heard of line break) like "\n" which is a line break, it also flush the 
                    output buffer. a buffer is a memory space used for temporarily storing data before it is
                    processed, flushing here just means that all the output will be written immediately. 
                    function can also be a special type called <code>void</code> type, basically
                    if you use <code>void</code> as the function's type, you cannot return any value, and it 
                    does not require you to use a return statement, as opposed to other types, like char, int..
                    you'd need to return a value of the function's type, or else it will throw an error.
                    </p></li>
                <li><p>thus we concluded..</p></li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li><h2>arrays, loops, conditional statements</h2></li>
                <li><p><h5 class="green-text">>we enter the realm of contiguous memory<br />
                    >conditions that may keep the loop to traverse the array forever?<br /></h5>
                    we have talked about the char type, but how to you declare one? here is how: 
                    <code>char c = 'h';</code><br /> easy, simple, no try hard, just single quotations, allowing
                    just a single character, you can put mutiple but only the character at the end will count.
                    But what can you possibly do with just one character? That is why char are mostly uses
                    as an array, <code>char name[7] = {'b', 'r', 'e', 'n', 't', 'o','n'};</code><br />
                    square braces next to the variable's name is used to declare an array, you'd also 
                    wanna to specify how <i>big</i> the array size should be, that is, the number inside
                    the array. Our current array can hold 7 element, which is 7 character. Now
                    we initialize the array using "{}" aka "list" initialization, now if you use list to
                    init the array, you wouldn't have to specify the size, because the compiler deduces
                    the size automatically, else, you would have to.. Although this is the case for static
                    array, which is the one we use, and is not quite flexible, we have dynamic arrays like 
                    vector, allocating new array on the heap etc.. But you don't have to worry about these
                    for now, we will dive into them later.</p></li>
                <li><p>Looooops, you have heard of a loop right? among majority of programming languages,
                    the concept of loops are.. Pretty much the same. You have this called a <code>while</code>
                    loop, a <code>for</code> loop, a ranged based loop, <code>do while</code> loops. We'll
                    dive into each of them, starting with the while loop:<br />
                    <pre><code>while (condition) { logic...} </code></pre><br /> Now I'd think you can use
                    your intuition to understand the snippet, but I'll explain it. The anatomy of this loop
                    statement, you first type <code>while</code>, and the parenthesis which contains the 
                    specific boolean expression that keeps the loop going.. if the expression, which is 
                    the condition, evaluates to true, then the loop will execute</p></li>
