                <li><p>So what on earth is this? hello world is generic.. SO let's print something 
                    else, here is a boiler plate for a c++ file</p></li>
                <li><pre><code>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    int main() {
        std::cout << "I AM THE GOD OF HELLFILE";

        return 0;
    }
</code></pre></li>
                <li><p>
                    What on earth is goin' on? Now it's time for inline comment to shine <br />
                    //this is a comment, double slash as in double tap<br /> //what is include?
                    a hash tag and the <b>include</b> keyword. Now "include", it is used to, well,
                    includes this type of file called "header", similar to a library, it will let you to
                    utilize the codes in the included header, like functions, classes.. <br /><br />
                    /*the header is "iostream", which we need to get our printing magic working. The main function,
                    serves as the, well, you name it, the main function of the program. This is where
                    your code will first be executed when you run the program.. As this function will be called
                    automatically, just make sure it is called <b>main</b>. <br /> as for the "std::cout" line
                    let me explain, std is the abbreviation for standard, which is the standard library that
                    C++ uses, it is a, really tremendous library, it have everything that C++ needs to
                    operates.. and iostream is a part of it, so when we use <b>std</b>, we specify that we're
                    using the std "namespace" <br /> Oh boy, now what is namespace? A namespace is like a
                    folder or a last name for your code
                    It helps you organize your functions, classes, and variables without name collisions,
                    Think of it this way:<br />
                    You're at a party and there are three people named <code>cout</code>. You shout "Hey cout!"<br />
                    Suddenly, chaos. Three confused programmers turn around<br /> as for the "::", this is
                    called scope resolution, we're going to see a lot more examples, but for now, it basically
                    let you select a specific function or variable from a specific class or namespace, like i
                    want to access a cake in bakeryOne, so i say <code>bakeryOne::chocolateCake</code><br />
                    in this case cout is part of std, So <code>std::cout</code> is our gateway to
                    print text. And guess what?<br />
                    <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the "insertion operator".
                    You're not just sending text. You're jamming it into the stream like stuffing glitter into
                    an envelope*/<br /><br /></p>

</h5> in C++, declaring a varible is quite simple.. We have several built in types, such as int, char, bool.. 
                    for an example, let's declare an interger variable: <br /><code>int i = 88;</code><br />
                    as you can see, we first need to declare a type for the variable, then the name, 
                    the variable's value are optional, meaning you can leave it without initialize any value
                    to the variable, just don't forget the semicolon ";", they pretty much just represent
                    the end of a statement, so always put them at the end. You can also initialize 
                    variable in a couple of ways, using =, using (), using {} -> <br /> int i = 1;
                    int i(1); int i{1};<br /></p>
                <li><p>C++ uses something called "static type checking", meaning you have to manually
                    declare the type for variables, instead of for example, JavaScript, where type are
                    dynamically check based on its value.. As for me I prefer static type, as it will
                    gives you more clarity on the intended type of the variable, including functions, 
                    and it is also faster</p></li>
                <li><p>Let's also talk about function, here is how to declare a function:<br />
                    <code>int squaredNumber(int x) { return x*x; }</code><br /> so the anatomy of a valid
                    function, you'll need, the type, the name, "()" also called function call operator, 
                    and lastly, {} two curly braces. You can also take something called parameter, in 
                    the parentheses, like you've seen, (int x), this will specify the type when the value
                    is passed to the parameter, when we pass a value to a function, it is called "argument"
                    <br /> for example i can do something like this: <code>int squared = 
                    squaredNumber(2);</code> <br /> and then I'll print it: <code>std::cout << squared 
                    << std::endl;</code> <br /> as we can see, we assigned the result of squaredNumber to
                    the variable squared, which it should be 4 because we pass 2 as the argument. and then
                    print the variable which will give us 4 as the output, we also have some new keywords,
                    in which I'll also give you the definition of each.. <br /><br /> <code>return</code>: 
                    end the function execution and, like the name, it return a value to where it was 
                    requested, and in this case, it is our variable.<br /> <code>endl</code>: it adds a new 
                    line(I know you've heard of line break) like "\n" which is a line break, it also flush the 
                    output buffer. a buffer is a memory space used for temporarily storing data before it is
                    processed, flushing here just means that all the output will be written immediately. 
                    function can also be a special type called <code>void</code> type, basically
                    if you use <code>void</code> as the function's type, you cannot return any value, and it 
                    does not require you to use a return statement, as opposed to other types, like char, int..
                    you'd need to return a value of the function's type, or else it will throw an error.
                    </p></li>
                <li><p>thus we concluded..</p></li>
            </ol>

                    >conditions that may keep the loop to traverse the array forever?<br /></h5>
                    we have talked about the char type, but how do you declare one? here is how: 
                    <code>char c = 'h';</code><br /> easy, simple, no try hard, just single quotations, allowing
                    just a single character, you can put mutiple but only the character at the end will count.
                    But what can you possibly do with just one character? That is why char are mostly uses
                    as an array, <code>char name[7] = {'b', 'r', 'e', 'n', 't', 'o','n'};</code><br />
                    square braces next to the variable's name is used to declare an array, you'd also 
                    wanna to specify how <i>big</i> the array size should be, that is, the number inside
                    the square braces. Our current array can hold 7 element, which is 7 character. Now
                    we initialize the array using "{}" aka "list" initialization, now if you use list to
                    init the array, you wouldn't have to specify the size, because the compiler deduces
                    the size automatically, else, you would have to.. Although this is the case for static
                    array, which is the one we use, and is not quite flexible, we have dynamic arrays like 
                    vector, allocating new array on the heap etc.. But you don't have to worry about these
                    for now, we will dive into them later.</p></li>
                <li><p>Looooops, you have heard of a loop right? among majority of programming languages,
                    the concept of loops are.. Pretty much the same. You have this called a <code>while</code>
                    loop, a <code>for</code> loop, a ranged based loop, <code>do while</code> loops. We'll
                    dive into each of them, starting with the while loop:<br />
                    <pre><code>while (condition) { //logic...} </code></pre><br /> Now I'd think you can use
                    your intuition to understand the snippet, but I'll explain it. The anatomy of this loop
                    statement, which includes a <code>while</code> keyword, and the parentheses which contains 
                    the specific boolean expression that keeps the loop going.. if the expression, which is 
                    the condition, evaluates to true, then the loop will execute. It is like, while my car
                    has fuel, I can drive it. and then we have curly braces, which specify the scope of this
                    statement, as for this one, similarly to a function, is a block level statement, it can
                    group several statements in a block, enclosed in curly braces, a statement can be a 
                    variable, a boolean expression, a loop etc.. And as for statements declared within
                    the block, can only be access within its scope, so if you declare a variable in this while
                    loop, then you can't access it anywhere else, unless if we use something like a <code>
                    reference</code> or a <code>pointer</code>.. But we will not discuss them for now, but we'll 
                    keep them in mind.<br /><br /> we will now move on to the <code>for</code> loop, the 
                    anatomy of the for loop is a bit more flexible comparing to the while loop: <br />
                    <code>for (control variable; condition; update) { //logic... }</code><br /> looking at the 
                    code, you can see that we've replaced the while, with for, along with a couple 
                    more statements in the parentheses, "control variable", is a variable you'll use to control
                    the loop, typically an int like <code>int i = 0</code>, as for the condition, in the
                    context of a for loop, we normally compare i to another number, like <code> i < x</code>
                    , and if the condition evaluates to true, then the loop executes. As for the third 
                    statement, this is where you will update, typically, you gonna increment the control 
                    variable, not strictly, but for a loop, this works well.. As a for loop general usage is 
                    to repeat a task for a set amount of times, like <code>i++</code>, the variable name and
                    2 plus sign next to it, this is called the incremant operator "++". Also suffix or 
                    prefix does not matter, <code>++i</code> and <code>i++</code> will both works. You will
                    also enclosed the loop in curly braces {}, but a fun fact is that you omit the braces, as
                    in excluding the curly braces, but this will only works for a single statement only. If
                    you have mutiple statments, only the first statement will be executed, this applies to 
                    while loop, for, loop and if else statements.. Talk about if statement, we will get to them
                    after 2 more kind of loop you need to know. And make sure you add ; after each statement
                    in the for loop parentheses, now we gonna talk about <code>range based loop</code><br />
                    a range based for loop, is another kind of for loop, but slightly different. So Let's 
                    dissect this one:<br /> <code>for (variable : collection) { //logic... }</code><br /> so in
                    this snippet, we can see that is similar to a foor loop, but without any condition. Instead
                    you can use this loop to iterate, traversing through a collection, in this case it can be
                    an array, like <code>char name2[7] = { 't', 'a', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'n', 't' };</code><br />
                    and the variable will be the element of the collection, that is, each character in this 
                    array, starting from 0, and increment until all element has been going through, so if the
                    array has 7 elements, then the loop runs 7 time, pretty cool right? You can do anything in
                    the loop's body, which is the enclosed curly braces, so an example could be (char c : name2)
                    , which you can use c in the loop. I can maybe change 't', the first element of the name2
                    array, into 'b', that is only the case if you <code>&</code> as the variable's name prefix,
                    that is, behind the name like &c, which let you change the corresponding element directly
                    in the array. This is called a reference, and the ampersand '&', in this case is called the 
                    address-of operator, without it, the variable would be a copy instead, which the changes 
                    you make to the variable won't affect the element in that array. We will soon dive more into
                    references, but now let's dive into the final loop variant<br /> the <code>do while
                    </code> loop.. This loop is built different. Unlike other loops, the <code>do while</code> 
                    executes the code block at least once, no matter what.<br /><br /> You write it like this:
                    <pre><code>
    do {
       //logic..
    } while (condition);
    </code></pre>
                    and again you can't forget the semicolon, the compiler's got standards, baby. And
                    <br /> Here's what’s cool, the condition comes after the logic. So even if the condition 
                    is false, the block gets one run. so you can call it a <code>while</code> loop that runs
                    once regardless of conditions</p><br /></li>
                <li><p>if, else, else if, switch <br /> these statements, are the gate keepers, law 
                enforcements of your code.. You can't let every code execute, every parameter passing through,
                can't let 3/2 going into the even number row. So now, let's get into the <code>if</code> 
                statement. Let's say I have a variable: <code>bool flag = true;</code> <br /> now this variable
                is a boolean, and its value equate to true. Now I have an if statement: <code>if (condition)
                { //logic... }</code> <br /> familiar yet? We can check if flag is true or false, like if 
                (flag == true), now this code, checks its value using "==" which is something called the equality
                operator, which return true or false depending on, in this case, if flag == true. But if you
                simply want to check if a boolean is true or not, simply use "!", like !flag to check if flag
                is false, and simply put flag if you want to check if the value == true, (!flag), (flag)<br />
                to understand these concepts more clearly, I also need to tell you about something called 
                "truthy" and "falsy" values. Now, any integer that is not equal to 0, is truthy, that includes
                some more data types, like float, double, which are built in number type like int, except the
                value have decimal place, like 0.00, this applies for both float and double. Negative numbers
                like -1, -3.00, are also considered to be truthy values. As for types like <code>string</code>
                or <code>char</code>, which deals with letters, symbols, numbers enclosed in double quotation ""
                for string, and '' for char, now an empty string is a falsy value, but for a char, it will 
                throw an error. Now we won't get too in depth with them, but you wanna keep them in mind. Next
                is <code>else if</code>, now else if works just like if, except that else if is used <i>IF</i>
                the first if statement equate to true, which the code moves on to the first else if statement,
                if there are any, that is. And if the first else if equate to false again, then the code moves
                    to the second else if, and so on.. You see the pattern? it continues the check until a 
                    statement returns true. Now we have <code>else</code>, the main difference of else is that
                    you can't provide any condition to it like if and else if, so no parentheses. It will be
                    used if all of the if, else if statements returns false, which means none of the conditions 
                    are met and therefore, else think, therefore else am..<br /> And lastly, we have the 
                    <code>switch</code> statement, switch statement are like the swiss knife of conditional
                    statement, and I'll explain why it is:<br /><pre>
switch (expression) {
    case constant1:
        //Do something
        break;
    case constant2:
        //Do something else
        break;
    default:
        //Do this if none of the above cases match
}
</pre><br />now looking at the anatomy of the switch statement, you can think of it like, here's an expression. 
                    Now go compare it to a bunch of predefined options (case) and execute whatever matches,
                    and what does the expression represent in this case? It is not a condition, rather, The 
                    expression inside a switch must evaluate to an integral or enumeration type.
                    Meaning it’s gotta be something that can be measured in whole number, so for things like,
                    int, char, enum, type modifiers like long, short, long long, signed, unsigned.. Okay, now
                    I know I just randomly throw these terms to you, and you probably have no idea what they are
                    but don't worry, we will get into them in another part, just know that these are basically
                    different flavors of interger.. Now if I have an int variable, now I can check for each
                    potential case where the int value, be it 1, 2, or 3, for each specific match, shall i 
                    have a different approach to each case. That's the virtue of switch statement.. In the case
                    like this, switch statement offer more readability and simplicity comparing to a chained
                    if else statements. Now you also must have noticed the <code>break</code> statement, break
                    statement is used to stop the execution of a code block, do you remember what a block is? It
                    is where you group mutiple statements into a block using {}, which you can say the break 
                    statement stops the execution in the scope where it is reside, this is to prevent further
                    case check when a case are match. However, you can omit the break statement, which in this 
                    case, is referring to something called "fall through", it symbol how the switch statement
                    will fall through all the cases without the break statement.. Quite intuitive, and you can
                    also group statements in a case using curly braces, as without it, only a statement which 
                    ends at ";", will be executed, so use {} if you want mutiple statements to execute in a case.
                    As for the last thing you wanna know, it will be the <code>default</code> case. A default
                    case is identical to the else statement, it will executes when none of the cases match, so
                    cases can be treat as if, else if, and default as else.</p>

                    Well, well, well, looks like that sum
                    it up, I recommend you to furtherly research on your own, about anything you find confusing
                    , and to also write a program to exercise, I want you to write a program that counts from
                    0 to 10, print each number, for odd numbers, label it as odd, and as for even, label it
                    correspondingly, use your acquired knowledge.<br /> I also recommend to use one compiler to 
                    write the code, it is on the web and it's quick and easy, as for long term you should use 
                    visual studio, or visual studio code, but I'm not gonna tell you how, research it on your 
                    own. (sorry for the passive aggressive tone, if you are still reading I just wanna let you 
                    know that you are lovely and beautiful)

                        your knowledge on types<br />
                    </h5> we have discussed about int, char, bool, a little bit
                    of float and double.. Now I'm gonna talk about <code>short, long, long long, unsigned</code>
                    we're also gonna distinguish interger from floating point. Interger are whole number, which are
                    numbers without decimal place. Now if you try to assign a floating point number, which is one
                    with decimal places, to an int, which is of interger type, will result in truncation of the
                    number. Which means that the decimal place will be removed:<code> 3.14 -> 3 </code><br /> so
                    <code>int i = 3.14</code> will simply be 3. The same will happen if you assign a whole number to
                    a float or a double, 3 -> 3.00.. This is called type conversion, which can be achieved manually
                    or automatically. Now we know the differences, let's discuss <code>
                        short, long, long long,
                        unsigned
                    </code><br /> These are called type modifier and belongs to the interger family, which
                    mean you can only use them with int, or, standalone by themselves with exception of double,
                    which you can use with long such as <code>long double</code>, as for short, it can be
                    either <code>short</code> or <code>short int</code>, which is equivalent and the same applies
                    to all the one listed above, although for clarity, i recommend to specify the int like long int,
                    short int..<br /> Now what exactly are these type modifiers usage? So the maxium value a numeric
                    type can hold depending on how many bytes it can holds. A byte, as might have heard, can be
                    kilobyte(kb), megabyte(mb), gigabyte(gb) and so.. In this case, 1000 bytes = 1kb, which is a lot
                    in our context, since an int is typically 4 bytes. For short int, it is only 2 bytes, but it
                    holds much less value, a range of -32,768 to 32,767. As opposed to a normal int, which can hold
                    -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648. We're currently talking in the context of signed intergers,
                    which can hold negative numbers and positive numbers, as for <code>unsigned</code> intergers, it
                    is a bit different. As it can only holds positive numbers, so essentially, signed numbers split
                    into 2, a negative halve and a positive halve, so turn the negative half into positive and add
                    it to the other half, and then you have the unsigned range.. So unsigned are basically the
                    absolute range, as absolute value are always positive.. SO if you assign a negative number to an
                    unsigned int, like -1, it will gives you 4294967295.. Which is the max range a normal int can
                    hold minus 1, and if you put -2, then you get 4294967294. So there is some sort of type
                    conversion plus how? I mean hey, you wouldn't want to assign a negative to an unsigned. So let's
                    just move on..<br /> Alright so unsigned short, long, long long are type modifier of interger,
                    and their capacity, which is the maxium value range they can hold, depeneding on how many bytes
                    they takes up, with short at the least, and long long at the most. You can also have unsigned
                    short, unsigned long, unsigned long long..<br /> Now I won't get too deep with binary code,
                    which are bits and bytes stores bits, base two number system which values are power of two's.
                    But maybe we will get to them <i>INT</i> the future<br /><br /> Now we have only spoke of
                    type modifiers for interger, so let's get into floating point and character wise.<br /><br />
                    floating point numbers, where numbers gets more specific.. Now you need decimals to represent
                    something like, for example, <i>PI</i>, which is 3.1415926535.. approximately. When you have a
                    number like that, you gonna use a type of something called floating point, specifically, <code>
                        double
                    </code>. Now in floating point numbers, there is something called precision, which the
                    higher the precision, the more, well, self explanatory, precise the decimal places will be in
                    the number. In the case of double, it can holds up to 15-16 decimal place of precision, while
                    <code>float</code> have only around 7 decimal place of precision. Which is why for things like
                    math constants and calculations, irrational numbers and such, typically uses double or long
                    double so that the computation will be more accurate.. Now this might not be your biggest
                    concern in the mean time, you definitely wants to look more into it. Now a fun fact is that int
                    and float both take the same amount of bytes, even though float is more complex and stores
                    decimals.. Which I won't explain because complex stuff.<br /><br /> Now let's get into.. Unicode
                    realm: <code>signed char | unsigned char | wchar_t | char16_t | char32_t </code><br /> So let's
                    first understand character encoding standards.. ASCII and Unicode. The two holy grail of
                    character encoding. ASCII is short for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange" and
                    Unicode means "Universal character encoding", now you know, when the internet wasn't as wide
                    spread and having such a gigantic ecosystem, being extremely complex as it is now.. Ascii was
                    pretty fine. Just English was fine, just Emoticons was fine ;) ... But then came emojis, then
                    it came Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Math symbols.. All sort of things that Ascii couldn't handle
                    and so forth, came Unicode, and that's it you don't expect me to explain the entire history
                    right?<br /> Now char can also be signed or unsigned.. Which you should get it by now, or not,
                    well, it is not the most important thing to understand now. But did you know you can assign
                    numbers to char? Yes that's right you can do something like <code>char c = 65;</code><br /> and
                    when you print it, you'll get.. "A", and you can actually assign a character to an int, and you
                    will get the character corresponding to that number.. So how?? Well, Ascii have 128 unique
                    characters, including numbers and symbols. So when you assign a number to a char, that number
                    will be converted into the corresponding character based on the Ascii order. And char, are
                    neither signed or unsigned by default, it actually depends on the compiler. And that might just
                    be the only usage you'd see from signed and unsigned char for now.. Let's now move onto wchar_t
                    , now <code>wchar_t</code> is a built in type used to represent wide characters. In
                    contrast to char which is typically an 8 bit type designed mainly for Ascii or other single
                    byte encodings, wchar_t is intended to handle larger encoding sets, especially those needed
                    in globalized applications. Essentially, it’s your tool for representing characters that
                    cannot be captured by the traditional 8 bit char. SO wide chars can store Ascii and unicode
                    characters, but not all, well, if you wanna know more i suggest looking into it.<br /> There
                    are some encoding when it comes to unicode like: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32. now imagine unicode
                    as a phonebook where every character in the world has a unique ID number called a code point
                    . Like A = U+0041, 你 = U+4F60, 😏 = U+1F60F.. And so on, but how do we store these IDs 
                    in memory? That’s where UTF 8/16/32 come in.. So UTF 8 is mostly used for Ascii, like simple
                    characters, english, emoticons and stuff like that, takes around 1 to 4 bytes. UTF 16 is
                    usually used for languages like Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, because it is faster in
                    some cases, takes 2 to 4 bytes. UTF 32 are pretty much the same as UTF 8 and 16 except that
                    every character = 4 bytes. So their main differences laid in, space taken(bytes), speed,
                    so yes, UTF 8 is more preferred, because it is more simple, takes less space...<br /> And
                    thus you have <code>char16_t, char32_t</code>, which ties to UTF 16 and UTF 32 respectively.
                    TO wrap it up: <code>char = UTF 8, wchar = UTF 16 or UTF 32, char16_t = UTF 16, 
                    char32_t = UTF 32.</code><br /> Now char is almost always your best friend, but others are 
                    not useless either... If you wanna learn more about them then search it up, i only cover 
                    the basic concept. Now, looks like we're gonna move to an universally known type..
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>STRING</h3><br /><p>We have talked about char, and how you can use it to store
                    characters, symbols, numbers as text. But here are a type, makes it more simple and straight
                    forward to store about just anything you type into it.. The <code>string</code> type. Now 
                    string are more straight forward in, perhaps you have heard of, Javascript, Java, Python, 
                    Ruby. But here, I know you need a bit more sharpening, so let's dive into string. We gonna 
                    first talk about C style string vs C++ style string, so C style string look like this:<code>
                    char c[] = "anders";</code> or <code>char c[] = {'p', 'a', 't', 'r', 'i', 'c', 'k', '\0'};
                    </code><br /> And yes, you can use "" also called string literal, with char type, same with
                    when using a pointer, which we gonna explain more later. Now one thing to be remember is 
                    that, manual char array using {}, needs to include this character '\0' which is called null
                      terminated character, typically at the end of the array. Now this character is used to 
                      mark the end of the string. So if you print it, it will not print the characters that 
                      comes after the '\0', so you should use it wisely. Now comes C++ String, which is a bit 
                      more simple and flexible, and to declare a string variable:<code>std::string name = 
                    "breivik";</code><br />  Now string in C++ are a part of the standard library, and in itself
                      , a class, that is why you use std::string. Now classes is still an undisclosed concept in 
                      this page, but soon. Now when we think of a string, we can think of it as more like an 
                      array of characters, now at the same time, arrays are contiguous in memory, so contiguous 
                      memory, you can think of as if we have an array of characters, then those characters are 
                      stored next to each other in the same memory location. We call this contiguous block of 
                      memory, and elements, the things like characters, or interger, are stored within that same
                      block of memory. Now another fun fact is that once you have the location of an element, you
                      can access the rest of the elements in that memory block, but I won't get into it 
                      specifically at the moment. I will explain memory address in Pointer and reference section.
                      <br /><br />Strings have a variety of methods, also known as member functions, which is 
                      class related, now we gonna get into some basic methods, the first one is: <code>size
                    </code><br /> now size() can be used to get the amount of elements, stored in the object, in
                      this case, can be a string. <code>name.size()</code> example. There is also length(), which
                      is exclusively used for strings, but they both do the same thing, and return the same type,
                      Called size_t, which is an unsigned interger type. Now we move on to: <code>empty</code>
                      <br /> empty() returns true or false depending on whether the object is... Empty or not,
                      which means whether there are any character in the string. Now the next method:<code>
                    at</code>, now at(index), let you select an element from the specified index, an example is,
                      if I have a string called greet with value "hi", and i print: greet.at(1), then I'll get:
                      i. This is more safe than subscripting in which you use the [].<br /> Next we have: <code>
                    clear</code>, now clear(), like the name suggest, it clears the object, which is the string.
                    <br /><br /> And well now... That's some of the basic methods of the string type. There are
                      many more but I won't list all of them, i recommend you looking up everything i taught you
                      for better clarity. And to also use these string methods, you need to include the string
                      header &lt;string&gt;, to use the string's methods.

                    So the summary of the section we've just learned: 
                    1.	Integer Types:<br />
                    •	int: Represents whole numbers (e.g., int i = 3;). Assigning a floating point 
                    number to an int truncates the decimal part (e.g., 3.14 -> 3).<br />
                    2.	Type Modifiers:<br />
                    •	short, long, long long, unsigned: These modify the size or range of integers.<br />
                    •	Example:<br />
                    •	short int: 2 bytes, range: -32,768 to 32,767.<br />
                    •	long int: 4 bytes or more, range: larger than int.<br />
                    •	unsigned int: Only positive values, effectively doubling the positive range.<br />
                    •	Unsigned Behavior: Assigning a negative value to an unsigned type results in 
                    unexpected values (unsigned int x = -1; gives 4294967295).<br />
                    3. Floating Point Types<br />
                    •	Types:<br />
                    •	float: ~7 decimal places of precision.<br />
                    •	double: ~15-16 decimal places of precision.<br />
                    •	long double: Higher precision than double.<br />
                    •	Use Case: Use double for precise calculations(math constants like π).<br />
                    4. Character Types
                    •	ASCII and Unicode:<br />
                    •	ASCII: Limited to 128 characters (English letters, numbers, symbols).<br />
                    •	Unicode: Supports global characters (e.g., emojis, non-English scripts).<br />
                    •	Character Types:<br />
                    •	char: Typically 1 byte, used for ASCII characters.<br />
                    •	wchar_t: Wide character type for Unicode.<br />
                    •	char16_t and char32_t: For UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoding, respectively.<br />

                        </h5>
                        pointers, references, and operators.. Now these are some of the most important concepts
                        in C++, and they are also the most confusing ones. So let's get into it. First off,
                        pointers. Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They point to the location
                        of another variable in memory, this allows you to manipulate data directly in memory,
                        which can be very powerful. To declare a pointer, you use the <code>*</code> symbol:
                        <code>int* ptr;</code> This declares a pointer to an integer. To assign a value to a
                        pointer, you use the address of operator <code>&</code>: <code>ptr = &i;</code> This assigns
                        the address of the variable <code>i</code> to the pointer <code>ptr</code>. You can then
                        dereference the pointer using the <code>*</code> operator: <code>*ptr = 10;</code> This sets
                        the value of <code>i</code> to 10. Now I'm gonna tell you what dereference means.. it
                        is basically the process of accessing the value stored at the memory address that the
                        pointer is pointing to. So when you dereference a pointer, you are accessing the value
                        of the variable that the pointer is pointing to. This is useful when you want to modify the
                        value of a variable without directly accessing it, but yeah memory address is a bit
                        confusing, so let's just say that a pointer is a variable that stores the address of
                        another variable, like i won't get into the details of how memory works, but just know
                        that pointers are used to access and manipulate data in memory, and memory here is
                        basically a place where data is stored, like the RAM in your computer.<br /> Pointers
                        can also be used with arrays, as arrays are essentially pointers to the first element
                        of the array. You can access elements of an array using pointers like this: <code>
                            arr[i] = *(ptr + i);
                        </code><br /> This accesses the element at i position in <code>
                            arr 
                        </code> using the pointer <code>ptr</code>, and if you're wondering how this works,
                        it is because the name of the array is a pointer to the first element of the array, so
                        when you add <code>i</code> to the pointer, it moves the pointer to the i-th element,
                        and then you dereference it to get the value. This is called pointer arithmetic, 
                        it allows you to perform arithmetic operations on pointers, like adding or subtracting
                        ... And hopefully that make some sense to you, if not, don't worry, it will come
                        . Now pointers can also be used with
                        functions, allowing you to pass variables by reference, this means that you can
                        modify the value of a variable in a function without returning it. To do this, you
                        use the <code>&</code> operator when declaring the function parameter: <code>
                        void func(int& i) { i = 10; } </code><br /> This allows you to modify the value of 
                        <code>i</code> in the function without returning it, and you can also use pointers to 
                        dynamically allocate memory using the <code>new</code> operator: <code> int *dynamicNum
                        = new int;</code> This allocates memory for an integer and assigns the address to the pointer
                        <code>dyanamicNum</code>, you can then use the pointer to access the memory: <code>*
                        dynamicNum = 10;</code> This sets the value of the memory to 10, and then you need to
                        deallocate the memory using the <code>delete</code> operator: <code>delete dynamicNum;
                        </code><br /> now deallocate, free, delete, they all kinda mean the same thing, but 
                        delete is the one you use in C++. This frees the memory that was allocated for the 
                        pointer, and you should always deallocate memory that you allocate with <code>new
                        </code> to avoid memory leaks, which is when memory is allocated but not deallocated
                        because of skill issue.. Just kidding but not really, it is a common mistake but 
                        we gonna dive more into memory management later.<br /> Now also, when you have a 
                        pointer, but you don't want to use it anymore, you can set it to <code>nullptr</code>
                        <br /> which can also be used as a placeholder for a pointer that doesn't point to
                        anything. This is useful for checking if a pointer is valid or not, beside nullptr
                        , you can also use <code>NULL</code>, which is a macro that represents a null pointer
                        . Now macro is a preprocessor directive that defines a constant value, and while it
                        sound like what??, it is actually pretty simple. A macro is just a way to define a constant
                        value that can be used throughout your code, and preprocessor directives are instructions  
                        that are processed before the code is compiled. So when you use a macro, the preprocessor
                        replaces the macro with its value before the code is compiled. This is useful for defining
                        constants that you want to use throughout your code, like <code>PI</code>, which is a
                        constant like you know... We gonna discuss more about these stuff in future chapters.

                    <h4>References</h4>
                    <p>
                        What if sometimes, you have a dog, named, maybe "Blondi" or something, and you want to
                        another name, like a nickname, but you don't want to change the original name, you
                        just want to give it a an alias... Right, so you can do that with references. A
                        reference is an alias for a variable, it allows you to create a new name for an
                        existing variable.<br /> To declare a reference, you use the <code>&</code> symbol,
                        which hopefully, you already get used to because we have mentioned it before: <code>
                            int& ref = i;
                        </code> This creates a reference to the variable <code>i</code>. You can
                        then use the reference to access the value of the variable: <code>ref = 10;</code>
                        This sets the value of <code>i</code> to 10, and yes, reference needs to have the
                        same type as the variable it is referencing, just like pointers. <br /> Now references
                        are useful for passing variables to functions without copying them, this is similar
                        to pointers, but references are easier to use and less error prone, and performance
                        wise, this is also better than passing by value, because it doesn't require copying
                        the variable, which can be expensive for large objects. So when you pass a variable
                        by reference, you are passing the address of the variable, not a copy of it. This
                        allows you to modify the value of the variable in the function without returning it,
                        though yes beaware that by doing so, you are modifying the original variable, so be
                        careful when using references. Here is an example of passing a variable by reference:
                        <br /> <code> void func(std::string& name) { name = "Eva"; } </code> <br /> now
                        hopefully you understood that, because I'm telling you, intuition is the key here
                        .<br /> So now, you may be wondering, what's the difference between pointers and
                        references? Well, the main difference is that pointers can be null(remember nullptr?),
                        while references has to be initalized straight away, like it can't be empty or null,
                        and you can't reassign a reference to another variable, once it is assigned, it is
                        assigned, so pointers might be more flexible, but references are safer and easier to
                        use in a sense of way, so both has their own niche you know.. <br /> And also,
                        references are automatically dereferenced, so you don't need to use the <code>*</code>
                        operator to access the value of the variable, you can just use the reference name
                        directly. This makes references easier to use than pointers, and you can also use
                        references with arrays, just like pointers, you can use references to access elements
                        of an array: <code>arr[i] = ref;</code> this accesses the element at i position in
                        <code>arr</code> using the reference <code>ref</code>. SO yeah, references are
                        pretty cool, and they are used a lot in c++. They are especially useful
                        when you want to pass large objects to functions without copying them, and they are
                        also used in operator overloading, which is a way to define how operators work with
                        user defined types, which, is another topic of discussion, but we will get into it.
                        Now talk about operators, shall we dive into it? <br />

                    <h4>All(almost) about Operators</h4>
                    <p>
                        <h5 class="green-text">>what do you know about operators?</h5>
                        You have used operators for, maybe in math, and math is a big part of programming.
                        Infact, programming is math, like you know binary and all that, and how binary are
                        just powers of 2, and how everything is just math. So basically, programming is math
                        , and operators are a big part of math. Okay maybe not all math but
                        definitely some crucial parts of it. So let's get into it. Now here we have
                        arithmetic operators, which are used for basic math operations like addition,
                        substraction, multiplication, and division. These are the most common operators you
                        will use in programming, and they are pretty simple to understand. So just in C++
                        alone we have: <code> +, -, *, /, %</code> which are addition, substraction, and
                        multiplication, division, and modulus respectively. Now these operators are largely
                        the same as in math, and as well as in other programming languages.
                        <br /> Now the modulus operator is used to get the remainder of a division
                        operation, so for example, if you have <code>17 % 2</code>, it will return 1, because
                        17 divided by 2 is 8 with a remainder of 1, so this is useful for checking if a number
                        is even or odd, like if a number is divisible by 2, then it is even, otherwise it is
                        odd. So you can use the modulus operator to check if a number is even or odd, like
                        this: <code>if (num % 2 == 0) { //even } else { //odd }</code> This checks if the
                        number is, well, even or odd... Now here is the thing, for an expression like that,
                        can be simplified by using the ternary operator, which is a shorthand way of writing
                        an if else statement, and it looks like this: <code>condition ? true : false</code>
                        <br /> So you can write the above expression like this: <code>
                            num % 2 == 0 ? //even :
                            //odd
                        </code> This is a shorthand way of writing an if else statement, and it is
                        pretty simple and useful. <br /><br /> Now we also have increment and decrement
                        operators, which are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. And
                        you have actually seen it before, like <code>i++</code> or <code>++i</code>, which
                        are the increment operators, and the same thing can be said for decrement operators
                        <code>i--</code> or <code>--i</code>. Now you may have notice the ++ or -- being
                        placed before the i or after the i, which i will explain now. the first one is
                        a prefix operator, which means it will increment or decrement the value before using
                        it, while the other one is a postfix operator, which means it will increment or
                        decrement the value after using it. So for example, if you have <code>
                            int i = 5;
                        </code> and you do <code>int j = ++i;</code>, then <code>j</code> will be 6, because
                        the value of <code>i</code> is incremented before it is assigned to <code>j</code>.
                        But if you do <code>int j = i++;</code>, then <code>j</code> will be 5, because the
                        value of <code>i</code> is incremented after it is assigned to <code>j</code>. So
                        this is a pretty important concept to understand, because at first i was confused
                        and thought they were the same and like it is just a matter of preference but
                        actually it is not, and it can lead to some unexpected results if you don't
                        understand it. So just remember that prefix operators increment or decrement the
                        value before using it, while postfix operators increment or decrement the value
                        after using it.<br /><br /> Now up next we have comparison operators, which are
                        used to compare two values and return a boolean value, which is either true or false.
                        Now you might or might not have heard of boolean expression before, but it is
                        basically an expression that evaluates to true or false, and it is used a lot in
                        programming, especially in conditional statements like if statements. So the
                        comparison operators are: <code>==, !=, <,>, <=, >=</code>, which are equal to,
                        not equal to, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or
                        equal to respectively. Now the type in which these operators return is gonna be
                        boolean, which is pretty straightforward, example is <code>
                            if (a == b)
                            { //do something }
                        </code> This checks if <code>a</code> is equal to <code>b</code>.
                        In the case where you just want to return a boolean value, you can just write
                        <code>return a == b;</code><br /> you can also use parentheses to group expressions
                        like this: <code>return ((a == b) && (c != d));</code><br> This checks if
                        <code>a</code> is equal to <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> is not equal to
                        <code>d</code>, so yes likwise, these operators are quite flexible and can be
                        used in many ways, and they are pretty simple to understand. <br /><br /> Now we
                        have logical operators, which are used to combine boolean expressions and return a
                        boolean value. And since we're talking about LOGICAL operators, we gonna be logical
                        as well, so the logical operators are: <code>&&, ||, !</code>, which when we translate
                        them to something you 'n i can understand, are AND, OR, NOT. So the AND operator
                        <code>&&</code> returns true if both expressions are true, the OR operator
                        <code>||</code> returns true if at least one expression is true, and the NOT
                        operator <code>!</code> returns true if the expression is false, and vice versa,
                        and perhaps we can even count in | and &amp; as bitwise operators, but these are
                        pretty uncommmon so we gonna save space for that later on.<br /> SO yes I believe
                        the operators are pretty self explanatory, and you can use them in many ways,
                        like combining boolean expressions, or checking conditions in if statements, or
                        even using them in loops. Alright now let's see how many operators we have left
                        to cover, so we have covered arithmetic operators, increment and decrement
                        operators, comparison operators, and logical operators, some ternary, which are pretty
                        sufficient for now when it comes to operators although there is more. We gonna explore
                        more about operators in future chapters, like bitwise operators, assignment,
                        operations with pointers, and operator overloading, which is a way to define how
                        operators work with user defined types, and it is a pretty advanced topic.

                        Well, well, well done my disciple, you have made it to the end of this current page
                        and you have learned a lot about cpp(c++) so far. You have learned about types, type
                        modifiers, variables, pointers, references, and operators. You have also learned
                        about strings, and how to use them in c++. You have learned about the differences
                        between c style strings and c++ style strings, and how to use the string class
                        in c++. You have also learned about the basic methods of the string class, and how
                        to use them. You have also learned about the differences between pointers and
                        references, and how to use them in c++. You have also learned about the different
                        types of operators in c++, and how to use them in your code. You also learned about
                        the importance of understanding these concepts, and how they are used in c++. Right?
                        Hopefully you did learned something I mean, you have read this far, so you must
                        absorbed something right?<br /><br /> So likewise, it wasn't exactly that long but
                        i still want to congratulate you for making it this far, now I have some exercises
                        for you to practice what you have learned: <br /> <!-- in a bulletpoint list-->
                        <ol>
                            <li>Write a program that declares a variable of each type we have discussed so far,
                                and print their values.</li>
                            <li>Write a program that uses pointers to swap the values of two variables</li>
                            <li>Write a program that uses references to swap the values of two variables</li>
                            <li>Write a program that uses strings to store and manipulate text</li>
                            <li>Write a program that uses operators to perform basic math operations</li>
                            <li>
                                Write a program to traverse a binary tree using pointers and references, and
                                print the values of the nodes in order (just kidding that is kinda
                                advanced and you don't need to know that yet)
