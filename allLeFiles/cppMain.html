        <div id="main-wrapper">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                C++ is a really good language, there is C++ everywhere!
                Made by the ultimate giga chad Bjarne Stroustrup at bell labs. So likewise, you wanna get
                into C++? I'm 'bout to tell you, it <b>ain't easy</b>. But It ain't impossible either
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><h2>I AM THE GOD OF HELLFILE, AND I BRING YOU.. FILE </h2></li>
                <li><p>So what on earth is this? hello world is generic.. SO let's print something 
                    else, here is a boiler plate for a c++ file</p></li>
                <li><pre><code>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    int main() {
        std::cout << "I AM THE GOD OF HELLFILE";
    }
</code></pre></li>
                <li><p>
                    What on earth is goin' on? Now it's time for inline comment to shine <br />
                    //this is a comment, double slash as in double tap<br /> //what is include?
                    a hash tag and the <b>include</b> keyword. Now "include", it is used to, well,
                    includes this type of file called "header", similar to a library, it will let you to
                    utilize the codes in the included header, like functions, classes.. <br /><br />
                    /*the header is "iostream", which we need to get our printing magic working. The main function,
                    serves as the, well, you name it, the main function of the program. This is where
                    your code will first be executed when you run the program.. As this function will be called
                    automatically, just make sure it is called <b>main</b>. <br /> as for the "std::cout" line
                    let me explain, std is the abbreviation for standard, which is the standard library that
                    C++ uses, it is a, really tremendous library, it have everything that C++ needs to
                    operates.. and iostream is a part of it, so when we use <b>std</b>, we specify that we're
                    using the std "namespace" <br /> Oh boy, now what is namespace? A namespace is like a
                    folder or a last name for your code
                    It helps you organize your functions, classes, and variables without name collisions,
                    Think of it this way:<br />
                    You're at a party and there are three people named <code>cout</code>. You shout "Hey cout!"<br />
                    Suddenly, chaos. Three confused programmers turn around<br /> as for the "::", this is
                    called scope resolution, we're going to see a lot more examples, but for now, it basically
                    let you select a specific function or variable from a specific class or namespace, like i
                    want to access a cake in bakeryOne, so i say <code>bakeryOne::chocolateCake</code><br />
                    in this case cout is part of std, So <code>std::cout</code> is our gateway to
                    print text. And guess what?<br />
                    <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the "insertion operator".
                    You're not just sending text. You're jamming it into the stream like stuffing glitter into
                    an envelope*/<br /><br /></p>
                </li>
                <li><p>so did ya learned anything? </p></li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li><h2>variable, type, function</h2></li>
                <li><p><h5 class="green-text">
                    >Be you<br />
                    >You expected this to be another generic tutorial<br />
                    >You're actually right<br />
                    >Still gotta do it i guess<br />
</h5> in C++, declaring a varible is quite simple.. We have several built in types, such as int, char, bool.. 
                    for an example, let's declare an interger variable: <br /><code>int i = 88;</code><br />
                    as you can see, we first need to declare a type for the variable, then the name, 
                    the variable's value are optional, meaning you can leave it without initialize any value
                    to the variable, just don't forget the semicolon ";", they pretty much just represent
                    the end of a statement, so always put them at the end. You can also initialize 
                    variable in a couple of ways, using =, using (), using {} -> <br /> int i = 1;
                    int i(1); int i{1};<br /></p>
                <li><p>C++ uses something called "static type checking", meaning you have to manually
                    declare the type for variables, instead of for example, JavaScript, where type are
                    dynamically check based on its value.. As for me I prefer static type, as it will
                    gives you more clarity on the intended type of the variable, including functions, 
                    and it is also faster</p></li>
                <li><p>Let's also talk about function, here is how to declare a function:<br />
                    <code>int squaredNumber(int x) { return x*x; }</code><br /> so the anatomy of a valid
                    function, you'll need, the type, the name, "()" also called function call operator, 
                    and lastly, {} two curly braces. You can also take something called parameter, in 
                    the parenthesis, like you've seen, (int x), this will specify the type when the value
                    is passed to the parameter, when we pass a value to a function, it is called "argument"
                    <br /> for example i can do something like this: <code>int squared = 
                    squaredNumber(2);</code> <br /> and then I'll print it: <code>std::cout << squared 
                    << std::endl;</code> <br /> as we can see, we assigned the result of squaredNumber to
                    the variable squared, which it should be 4 because we pass 2 as the argument. and then
                    print the variable which will give us 4 as the output, we also have some new keywords,
                    in which I'll also give you the definition of each.. <br /><br /> <code>return</code>: 
                    end the function execution and, like the name, it return a value to where it was 
                    requested, and in this case, it is our variable.<br /> <code>endl</code>: it adds a new 
                    line(I know you've heard of line break) like "\n" which is a line break, it also flush the 
                    output buffer. a buffer is a memory space used for temporarily storing data before it is
                    processed, flushing here just means that all the output will be written immediately. 
                    function can also be a special type called <code>void</code> type, basically
                    if you use <code>void</code> as the function's type, you cannot return any value, and it 
                    does not require you to use a return statement, as opposed to other types, like char, int..
                    you'd need to return a value of the function's type, or else it will throw an error.
                    </p></li>
                <li><p>thus we concluded..</p></li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li><h2>arrays, loops, conditional statements</h2></li>
                <li><p><h5 class="green-text">>we enter the realm of contiguous memory<br />
                    >conditions that may keep the loop to traverse the array forever?<br /></h5>
                    we have talked about the char type, but how do you declare one? here is how: 
                    <code>char c = 'h';</code><br /> easy, simple, no try hard, just single quotations, allowing
                    just a single character, you can put mutiple but only the character at the end will count.
                    But what can you possibly do with just one character? That is why char are mostly uses
                    as an array, <code>char name[7] = {'b', 'r', 'e', 'n', 't', 'o','n'};</code><br />
                    square braces next to the variable's name is used to declare an array, you'd also 
                    wanna to specify how <i>big</i> the array size should be, that is, the number inside
                    the square braces. Our current array can hold 7 element, which is 7 character. Now
                    we initialize the array using "{}" aka "list" initialization, now if you use list to
                    init the array, you wouldn't have to specify the size, because the compiler deduces
                    the size automatically, else, you would have to.. Although this is the case for static
                    array, which is the one we use, and is not quite flexible, we have dynamic arrays like 
                    vector, allocating new array on the heap etc.. But you don't have to worry about these
                    for now, we will dive into them later.</p></li>
                <li><p>Looooops, you have heard of a loop right? among majority of programming languages,
                    the concept of loops are.. Pretty much the same. You have this called a <code>while</code>
                    loop, a <code>for</code> loop, a ranged based loop, <code>do while</code> loops. We'll
                    dive into each of them, starting with the while loop:<br />
                    <pre><code>while (condition) { //logic...} </code></pre><br /> Now I'd think you can use
                    your intuition to understand the snippet, but I'll explain it. The anatomy of this loop
                    statement, which includes a <code>while</code> keyword, and the parenthesis which contains 
                    the specific boolean expression that keeps the loop going.. if the expression, which is 
                    the condition, evaluates to true, then the loop will execute. It is like, while my car
                    has fuel, I can drive it. and then we have curly braces, which specify the scope of this
                    statement, as for this one, similarly to a function, is a block level statement, it can
                    group several statements in a block, enclosed in curly braces, a statement can be a 
                    variable, a boolean expression, a loop etc.. And as for statements declared within
                    the block, can only be access within its scope, so if you declare a variable in this while
                    loop, then you can't access it anywhere else, unless if we use something like a <code>
                    reference</code> or a <code>pointer</code>.. But we will not discuss them for now, but we'll 
                    keep them in mind.<br /><br /> we will now move on to the <code>for</code> loop, the 
                    anatomy of the for loop is a bit more flexible comparing to the while loop: <br />
                    <code>for (control variable; condition; update) { //logic... }</code><br /> looking at the 
                    code, you can see that we've replaced the while, with for, along with a couple 
                    more statements in the parenthesis, "control variable", is a variable you'll use to control
                    the loop, typically an int like <code>int i = 0</code>, as for the condition, in the
                    context of a for loop, we normally compare i to another number, like <code> i < x</code>
                    , and if the condition evaluates to true, then the loop executes. As for the third 
                    statement, this is where you will update, typically, you gonna increment the control 
                    variable, not strictly, but for a loop, this works well.. As a for loop general usage is 
                    to repeat a task for a set amount of times, like <code>i++</code>, the variable name and
                    2 plus sign next to it, this is called the incremant operator "++". Also suffix or 
                    prefix does not matter, <code>++i</code> and <code>i++</code> will both works. You will
                    also enclosed the loop in curly braces {}, but a fun fact is that you omit the braces, as
                    in excluding the curly braces, but this will only works for a single statement only. If
                    you have mutiple statments, only the first statement will be executed, this applies to 
                    while loop, for, loop and if else statements.. Talk about if statement, we will get to them
                    after 2 more kind of loop you need to know. And make sure you add ; after each statement
                    in the for loop parenthesis, now we gonna talk about <code>range based loop</code><br />
                    a range based for loop, is another kind of for loop, but slightly different. So Let's 
                    dissect this one:<br /> <code>for (variable : collection) { //logic... }</code><br /> so in
                    this snippet, we can see that is similar to a foor loop, but without any condition. Instead
                    you can use this loop to iterate, traversing through a collection, in this case it can be
                    an array, like <code>char name2[7] = { 't', 'a', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'n', 't' };</code><br />
                    and the variable will be the element of the collection, that is, each character in this 
                    array, starting from 0, and increment until all element has been going through, so if the
                    array has 7 elements, then the loop runs 7 time, pretty cool right? You can do anything in
                    the loop's body, which is the enclosed curly braces, so an example could be (char c : name2)
                    , which you can use c in the loop. I can maybe change 't', the first element of the name2
                    array, into 'b', that is only the case if you <code>&</code> as the variable's name prefix,
                    that is, behind the name like &c, which let you change the corresponding element directly
                    in the array. This is called a reference, and the ampersand '&', in this case is called the 
                    address-of operator, without it, the variable would be a copy instead, which the changes 
                    you make to the variable won't affect the element in that array. We will soon dive more into
                    references, but now let's dive into the final loop variant<br /> the <code>do while
                    </code> loop.. This loop is built different. Unlike other loops, the <code>do while</code> 
                    executes the code block at least once, no matter what.<br /><br /> You write it like this:
                    <pre><code>
    do {
       //logic..
    } while (condition);
    </code></pre>
                    and again you can't forget the semicolon, the compiler's got standards, baby. And
                    <br /> Here's what’s cool, the condition comes after the logic. So even if the condition 
                    is false, the block gets one run. so you can call it a <code>while</code> loop that runs
                    once regardless of conditions</p><br /></li>
                <li><p>if, else, else if, switch</p><br /> these statements, are the gate keepers, law 
                enforcements of your code.. You can't let every code execute, every parameter passing through,
                can't let 3/2 going into the even number row. So now, let's get into the <code>if</code> 
                statement. Let's say I have a variable: <code>bool flag = true;</code> <br /> now this variable
                is a boolean, and its value equate to true. Now I have an if statement: <code>if (condition)
                { //logic... }</code> <br /> familiar yet? We can check if flag is true or false, like if 
                (flag == true), now this code, checks its value using "==" which is something called the equality
                operator, which return true or false depending on, in this case, if flag == true. But if you
                simply want to check if a boolean is true or not, simply use "!", like !flag to check if flag
                is false, and simply put flag if you want to check if the value == true, (!flag), (flag)<br />
                to understand these concepts more clearly, I also need to tell you about something called 
                "truthy" and "falsy" values. Now, any integer that is not equal to 0, is truthy, that includes
                some more data types, like float, double, which are built in number type like int, except the
                value have decimal place, like 0.00, this applies for both float and double. Negative numbers
                like -1, -3.00, are also considered to be truthy values. As for types like <code>string</code>
                or <code>char</code>, which deals with letters, symbols, numbers enclosed in double quotation ""
                for string, and '' for char, now an empty string is a falsy value, but for a char, it will 
                throw an error. Now we won't get too in depth with them, but you wanna keep them in mind</li>
